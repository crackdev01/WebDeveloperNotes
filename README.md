# WebDeveloperNotes
This is a collection of reference material and notes on my journey to being a full stack web developer. 

## notes

This is a cheat sheet for beginners. This is for me to keep track of those things I use and want to keep track of. I hope you find it useful.

I enjoy writing README files for my projects. They are so useful and tons of fun to code! However, I keep losing the reference and every time I go to make one, I have to go hunt for it. Now I have it here. [click here](https://help.github.com/en/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax#using-emoji), for the MD reference.
